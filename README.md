# Malaria lipid metabolism

Joint analysis of single cell RNA-seq from the IDC stages of <I>P. falciparum</I> and <I>P. berghei</I> led to the identification of a gene involved in lipid metabolism, named CAP. Experimental evidence indicates that CAP mediates its biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine through interaction with the host CTL1.

# Script guidance

The project includes raw count matrices and R scripts to analyse single cell RNA-seq data of <I>P. falciparum</I> and <I>P. berghei</I> parasite cells, along with bulk RNA-seq data for CAP Knockout in <I>P. berghei</I>. For lipidomics analysis, we exclusively used [MetaboAnalystR](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/docs/RTutorial.xhtml).
